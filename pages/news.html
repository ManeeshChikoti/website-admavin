                The Delhi-Mumbai expressway, hailed as India's monumental
                infrastructure project, has put the OOH sector into high gear.
                As India's longest expressway, spanning 1,386 kilometers, it has
                significantly reduced travel time between Mumbai and Delhi to
                only 12 hours, down from nearly 24 hours. The expressway's
                completion is anticipated by January 2024, with progress being
                made on multiple routes. Recently, PM Narendra Modi inaugurated
                the Sohna to Dausa stretch, which is expected to cut the
                distance between Gurgaon and Jaipur by two hours.
