      <h3 class="mt-4">Introduction to Indian and Global OOH</h3>
      <p>
        The Out-of-Home (OOH) advertising industry in India, like other
        industries, faced a massive downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
        However, the industry has started to see a significant revival in
        2021. Besides, the global OOH advertising industry has also been
        showing a similar trend with digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising
        gaining momentum. This case study examines the trends, challenges, and
        opportunities for the OOH advertising industry in India and globally.
      </p>

      <p class="pt-3">
        In India, the estimated total spend in OOH advertising in 2021 was Rs.
        2,178 crore, which is substantially lower than the Rs. 3,495 crore
        spent in 2019. However, the industry has shown signs of recovery, with
        a 69% increase in ad spend compared to 2020. The industry also
        experienced a decline in market share, slipping from 6% to 3% over the
        years, but it gained a 1% share over 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        Globally, the OOH advertising market was worth $33.47 billion in 2020
        and is expected to reach $38.39 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of
        2.8% during the forecast period. The global DOOH advertising market is
        expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2021 to 2028. The global
        market is dominated by North America, followed by Europe,
        Asia-Pacific, and the rest of the world.

      <!-- Segment Growth Section -->

      <h3 class="mt-3">Segment Growrth</h3>

      <p>
        Conventional OOH market in India grew by 63%, while Transit Media grew
        by almost 100% in 2021. However, when compared to 2019, the
        Conventional OOH market still below pre pandemic level by 28% while
        Transit Media is below by 63%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indian Digital OOH market, in keeping with global trends, is beginning
        to take root, with an estimated 60,000 screens in 2021, up from 55,000
        in 2020. DOOH spends also moved up phenomenally from Rs. 50 crore to
        300 crore in 2021, but like Traditional OOH, it collapsed from Rs. 600
        crore in 2019 to Rs. 50 crore in 2020. Digital OOH now has a share of
        13.77%, but it is far below the global average of 40% while some
        Southeast Asian countries like Singapore has 60% DOOH adoption.
      </p>
      <p>
        The global DOOH advertising market is driven by the increasing
        adoption of programmatic advertising, rising demand for better
        audience targeting, and the growing trend of data-driven advertising.
        The market is also driven by the increasing popularity of digital
        signage and the need for real-time content management.

      <!-- Reason for Growth section -->

      <h3 class="mt-3">Reason for Growth of DOOH in India</h3>
      <ol type="1">
        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Growing use of digital technology:</strong> India has
          experienced a rapid increase in the use of digital technology which
          has led to a greater demand for digital advertising solutions,
          including DOOH, which can provide advertisers with more targeted and
          dynamic messaging.
        </li>
        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Improved infrastructure: </strong> The infrastructure for
          DOOH has improved significantly in India, with the installation of
          digital screens in high-traffic areas such as airports, railway
          stations, and malls.
        </li>
        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Better measurement and accountability: </strong>With the
          use of digital technology, it has become easier to measure the
          effectiveness of DOOH campaigns and to hold advertisers accountable
          for their spending.
        </li>
        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Creative flexibility:</strong> DOOH offers advertisers
          greater flexibility, allowing them to produce dynamic and engaging
          campaigns.

      <h3 class="font-weight-bold p-2">Future of OOH & DOOH in India:</h3>

      <ol type="1">
        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Growth Potential:</strong> The OOH advertising market in
          India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.6% between 2021 and 2026,
          according to a report by Mordor Intelligence. The DOOH market is
          also expected to grow significantly, with a CAGR of 25.6% between
          2020 and 2025, according to a report by Research and Markets.
        </li>

        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Digital transformation:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has
          accelerated the digital transformation of OOH advertising in India,
          with more companies investing in DOOH to reach consumers who are
          spending more time outdoors. In fact, the DOOH market in India is
          expected to grow from $65 million in 2020 to $200 million by 2025,
          according to the Research and Markets report.
        </li>

        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Integration with technology:</strong> DOOH advertising is
          likely to become more tech-driven, with the integration of digital
          technologies such as programmatic advertising, real-time bidding,
          and data analytics. This will provide advertisers with more targeted
          and personalized advertising solutions.
        </li>

        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Changing consumer Behavior: </strong> The increasing
          adoption of smartphones and other mobile devices has changed the way
          consumers interact with OOH advertising. According to a report by
          Nielsen, 50% of Indian consumers have engaged with OOH ads via their
          mobile devices, making it important for advertisers to integrate
          mobile marketing strategies with their OOH campaigns.
        </li>

        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Impact of 5G: </strong> The rollout of 5G networks in India
          is expected to have a significant impact on the OOH and DOOH
          advertising industries. 5G networks will allow for faster and more
          reliable data transfer, which will enable advertisers to create more
          immersive and interactive advertising experiences.
        </li>

        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Emphasis on creativity: </strong>With increasing
          competition in the OOH and DOOH advertising industries, advertisers
          will need to focus on creativity and innovation to stand out from
          the crowd. This will require collaboration between advertisers,
          creative agencies, and technology providers.
        </li>

        <li class="pt-4">
          <strong> Impact of regulations: </strong> The Indian government has
          proposed regulations to improve transparency and accountability in
          the OOH industry, which could have an impact on the industry in the
          coming years. Advertisers will need to adapt to these changes and
          ensure compliance with the new regulations.
