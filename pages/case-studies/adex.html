        <h3 class="mt-4">Introduction to Indian and Global OOH</h3>
        <p>
          The Out-of-Home (OOH) advertising industry in India, like other
          industries, faced a massive downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
          However, the industry has started to see a significant revival in
          2021. Besides, the global OOH advertising industry has also been
          showing a similar trend with digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising
          gaining momentum. This case study examines the trends, challenges, and
          opportunities for the OOH advertising industry in India and globally.
        </p>

        <p class="pt-3">
          In India, the estimated total spend in OOH advertising in 2021 was Rs.
          2,178 crore, which is substantially lower than the Rs. 3,495 crore
          spent in 2019. However, the industry has shown signs of recovery, with
          a 69% increase in ad spend compared to 2020. The industry also
          experienced a decline in market share, slipping from 6% to 3% over the
          years, but it gained a 1% share over 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Globally, the OOH advertising market was worth $33.47 billion in 2020
          and is expected to reach $38.39 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of
          2.8% during the forecast period. The global DOOH advertising market is
          expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2021 to 2028. The global
          market is dominated by North America, followed by Europe,
          Asia-Pacific, and the rest of the world.

        <h3 class="mt-3">Segment Growrth</h3>

        <p>
          Conventional OOH market in India grew by 63%, while Transit Media grew
          by almost 100% in 2021. However, when compared to 2019, the
          Conventional OOH market still below pre pandemic level by 28% while
          Transit Media is below by 63%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian Digital OOH market, in keeping with global trends, is beginning
          to take root, with an estimated 60,000 screens in 2021, up from 55,000
          in 2020. DOOH spends also moved up phenomenally from Rs. 50 crore to
          300 crore in 2021, but like Traditional OOH, it collapsed from Rs. 600
          crore in 2019 to Rs. 50 crore in 2020. Digital OOH now has a share of
          13.77%, but it is far below the global average of 40% while some
          Southeast Asian countries like Singapore has 60% DOOH adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The global DOOH advertising market is driven by the increasing
          adoption of programmatic advertising, rising demand for better
          audience targeting, and the growing trend of data-driven advertising.
          The market is also driven by the increasing popularity of digital
          signage and the need for real-time content management.

          <li class="pt-4">
            <strong> Growth Potential:</strong> The OOH advertising market in
            India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.6% between 2021 and 2026,
            according to a report by Mordor Intelligence. The DOOH market is

          </li>

          <li class="pt-4">
            <strong> Digital transformation:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has
            accelerated the digital transformation of OOH advertising in India,
            with more companies investing in DOOH to reach consumers who are
            spending more time outdoors. In fact, the DOOH market in India is

            according to the Research and Markets report.

          <li class="pt-4">
            <strong> Integration with technology:</strong> DOOH advertising is
            likely to become more tech-driven, with the integration of digital
            technologies such as programmatic advertising, real-time bidding,
            and data analytics. This will provide advertisers with more targeted
            and personalized advertising solutions.

          <li class="pt-4">
            <strong> Changing consumer Behavior: </strong> The increasing
            adoption of smartphones and other mobile devices has changed the way
            consumers interact with OOH advertising. According to a report by

            mobile devices, making it important for advertisers to integrate
            mobile marketing strategies with their OOH campaigns.

            is expected to have a significant impact on the OOH and DOOH

          <li class="pt-4">
            <strong> Emphasis on creativity: </strong>With increasing
            competition in the OOH and DOOH advertising industries, advertisers
            will need to focus on creativity and innovation to stand out from
            the crowd. This will require collaboration between advertisers,
            creative agencies, and technology providers.
          </li>

          <li class="pt-4">
            <strong> Impact of regulations: </strong> The Indian government has
            proposed regulations to improve transparency and accountability in
            the OOH industry, which could have an impact on the industry in the
            coming years. Advertisers will need to adapt to these changes and
            ensure compliance with the new regulations.
