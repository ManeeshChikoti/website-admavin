          IMPACT OF COVID ON OOH
        </h1>
      </div>

      <h3 class="mt-3">The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        The two most negatively affected industries due to the COVID19
        Pandemic lockdown, were Travel & Tourism and Out of Home
        Advertisement. The OOH Industry suffered majorly as movement of people
        (User Mobility) on primary roads - most commonly used for Billboard
        Advertising - fell by drastic proportions (close to 100%). Even after
        the lockdown was lifted, a huge chunk of people preferred to stay at
        home and their mobility couldn’t move to pre-pandemic levels for quite
        some time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the lockdown was lifted, the OOH Advertising Industry which was
        barely recovering from the economic shock tried to understand the
        impact of COVID on various aspects of their businesses
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-3">The Approach</h3>
      <p>
        The AdMAVIN team (co-founded by IIT Madras Alumni) and Technology
        partner to some of the leading Outdoor Media agencies of India devised
        a unique indigenous methodology to measure impact of COVID Lockdown on
        daily mobility, specifically the impression numbers on every road
        segment. In simple terms,<br />
        if <b>‘X’</b> number of people were passing by the billboards, then
        <u>what is the percentage change in these numbers post relaxation of
          the Lockdown?</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        The AdMAVIN team developed an algorithm and launched a unique
        <b>“COVID Impact Tool”</b> for its agency partners to measure the
        change in impression numbers or mobility due to the Lockdown. This was
        well publicized by some of our partners in the media.
        <a class="text-secondary" href=" https://www.afaqs.com/news/advertising/madison-ooh-
          updates-traffic-count-tool-for-covid19-unlock">
          reference
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        AdMAVIN has garnered a strong reputation for building indigenous
        methodologies and algorithms which are based on reliable and accurate
        data sources. In this case, the <b>COVID Impact Tool</b> relied
        primarily on the <b>Google Mobility Report</b> as explained below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google Mobility Report presented mobility trends in several
        categories. Such trends are analyzed on a monthly basis as shown in
        the image.
      </p>

      <div class="text-center my-2">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="../../assets/case-study/covid-impressions/covid-mobility-report.png" alt="" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Here Google suggests changes in footfall of several cumulative
        <b>Points of Interests(POI)</b> categories for example, Public
        transport, Workplace and Residential places among many others.
      </p>

      <p>
        It doesn’t directly solve the problem of the OOH industry. Industry
        wanted to know more about change in mobility which pertains to routes
        taken by users as most of the billboards, unipoles, bus shelters etc.
        are placed along the routes. Moreover Google Mobility report didn’t
        Change in Mobility over a given POI and was cumulative. For example,
        if one wanted to know the impact on mobility on AdMAVIN Office in IIT
        Madras, Google Mobility won’t address it. It will tell the impact of
        Covid on mobility across all the offices in Chennai. So the OOH
        Agencies were still looking desperately for a solution to meet their
        requirements, i.e.
        <b><u>Measurement of Impact localized or scaled down to a media site or
            Road segment level.</u></b>
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-3">The Solution</h3>
      <h3>Formulation of methodology using Google Mobility Report</h3>

      <p>
        Mobility information of the user is directly related to POI data. If
        someone travels from a residential society to a nearby school to drop
        off his/her ward, we can very well understand the route that he/she
        must have taken for the trip. Thus POI data can also give us route
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any change in footfall of POI can very much be related to footfall of
        the audience on roads and thus also tells us about change in
        impression numbers for OOH Advertisements. Let’s build on this useful
        understanding!
      </p>

      <div class="text-center my-2">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="../../assets/case-study/covid-impressions/moving-covid-mobility-report.gif"
          alt="" />
      </div>

      <p>
        A perimeter of radius 1000 meters around the road’s coordinate is used
        to understand the locality by analyzing the Points of Interest (POI)
        present in it.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <u>AdMAVIN used the following classifications of POI-:</u>
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Sustenance/Eateries</li>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Transportation</li>
        <li>Entertainment</li>
        <li>Residential</li>
        <li>Commercial</li>
        <li>Industrial</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These POI Classifications are mapped with Google's place categories
        (from the Mobility Report), to map the classification wise change in
        percentage. As a given location contains various kinds of POIs, we can
        estimate the change in percentage by calculating the weighted average
        of the change percentage of these respective categories. An example
        calculation is provided in the example section.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <u>Key Notes / Observations:</u>
      </h3>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          The change percentages of Google Report are not Traffic Change
          percentages. They are the avg. change in people observed in a given
          Point of Interest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even though the residential areas have a +ve change in mobility, the
          overall traffic change can still be -ve in residential areas due the
          drop in the other Points of Interest (shops, restaurants, etc.) in
          that locality.
        </li>
        <li>
          As the Google report provides the day-wise change percentages since
          Feb 15th 2020, the OTS can also be measured day wise from Feb 15th
          till date. The Image below shows the day-wise change percentage of
          mobility.
        </li>

        <div class="text-center my-2">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../../assets/case-study/covid-impressions/day-wise-change-covid-ots.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <li>
          Google mobility reports are released with a delay of 4 days to one
          week. Hence the OTS can be measured for any day up until a week
          before from any given day.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>

        <li>Transportation : 8.0%</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Post the Mapping of mobility classification, the traffic

      <p>
        As the OTS changes daily and can be estimated for
        <u>any date between Mar 15th till date</u>, find below the OTS data
