    <h3 class="mt-4">The Customer</h3>

    <div class="text-justify">
      <p>
        YLG is a women salon and spa chain with an online store based out of
        Bangalore. It offers innovative beauty services that women need for
        a complete couture look. In order to increase the brand awareness,
        retain visibility and footfalls to their stores, they had engaged in
        Billboard advertising at locations close to their stores.
      </p>

      <p>
        When
        <a class="text-secondary" href="https://www.admavin.com">
          AdMAVIN
        </a>
        reached out to them, YLG wanted to know if we could help them gauge
        the efficacy of their existing billboards and, if possible, suggest
        alternatives which might be more cost-effective.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-justify">
      <h3 class="mt-4">The Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Billboards serve as an excellent reminder medium, helping gain
        top-of-the-mind recall amongst customers when they are outside their
        homes. In the case of John Jacobs, they have opened stores in the
        commercial hubs of Indiranagar and Koramangala (where people often
        come with the purpose of shopping / hanging out with friends), and
        the purpose of the billboard advertisements was to increase
        footfalls to their stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task at hand was to ensure that using our proprietary
        <a class="text-secondary" href="https://www.admavin.com/"> MAVIN</a>
        platform, we needed to suggest billboards which would be more
        effective (in terms of visibility and therefore creating brand
        awareness) while ensuring that they are well within their stipulated
        budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        YLG's campaign was conducted over 15+ billboards across the city.
        For the study purpose, we selected four billboards, one billboard in
        Indiranagar, one in Koramangala near Sony World signal, one in
        Jayanagar near Canara bank and one in Cambridge layout.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">The Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        The customer segment of YLG is predominantly Sec-A and Sec-B women,
        who aspire for great looks. While suggesting better alternatives, we
        needed to ensure that the demographics of the target population of
        the billboards doesn't change.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        At present, the billboards have been selected keeping the following
        aspects in mind -
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Presence on routes leading to the stores</li>
        <li>Distance of billboard to store &lt; 2 km</li>
        <li>Apparent cost / Approximate views (the lower the better)</li>
        <li>
          General understanding of profile of public crossing those
          billboards
        </li>
      </ul>

        As seen above, we see a <b>significant (1.5x) increase</b> in the
        <b>No. of Impressions</b> that would be garnered by the billboards
        suggested through the MAVIN platform as compared to the current
        billboard on which YLG is advertising at Indiranagar. We see that
        the CPM also increases by <b>1.02x</b>. Also, comparison is not only
        dependent on the quantitative analysis, demographics also plays a
        hand. Having an understanding of best location boost the probability
        of message reaching to the right audience.

    <p>
      The billboards in Koramangala are of the same cost. Hence as the
      number or <b>impressions increase by 1.5x</b> the
      <b>CPM is reduced by 1.5x</b>. The proposed site is at the junction
      and next to a signal and hence better views are expected. Having a
      better Sustenance also suggests good quality targeted customer in the
      region for YLG. Hence, knowing the demographics help. A comparative
      study of demographics present insightful information to help devise
      relevant strategies in the particular area.

      <p>
        With the power of MAVIN, getting an understanding that the site you
        own is best is not an intuition based decision but a data backed
        one. Also, getting an in-depth analysis of the demography is always
        helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site at Jayanagar is one of the best location for YLG to
        advertise for their store. With backing from data, YLG should stick
        to purchasing with the mentioned site. However, gaining an
        understanding of demographics, site selection could change. Though,
        not in this case as demographics of the site are also favourable.

      As seen above, we see a billboard on the same lane and almost of the
      same size and width is a good alternate to the present billboard on
      Bellary road. AdMAVIN platform helps you compare the quality of the
      billboard. In this case, the
      <b>quality of billboard</b> by YLG is better than the alternate via a
      <b>small fraction i.e. 4.2:4</b>
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
      The case study on YLG's billboard provided multiple striking and
      valuable insights. We explored a good understanding of billboard
      buying by YLG, as two among the four sites are better than the
      suggested alternates. We compared alternates which were giving same
      insights but differ in the alignment or quality of billboard. Also, we
      got to see that a proof of validation by data selection is essential
      for media buying. In the clutter of advertising, data is all that
      could help take informed decision. Both quantitative and qualitative
      data drives site selection. Having an understanding of the same, you
      could be confident of your selections and make decisions which boost
      your interactions with the customer.
