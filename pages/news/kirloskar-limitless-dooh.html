          A 130-year-old industry leader, Kirloskar refreshes its campaign with
          a new age Digital OOH at the Mumbai Airport in partnership with Times
          OOH.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spirit of innovation and purpose was captured through a new OOH
          Campaign – “Limitless” last year which has now been taken to the
          masses with the help of Airport Campaign.<br />
          The refreshing and re-energizing new campaign looks to expound on the
          Limitless philosophy in a simple, relatable & engaging manner that
          celebrates the brand’s shared philosophy with that of the innate human
          desire to challenge the limits and live, think and dream limitlessly.
          The brand in association with their advertisement media agency- Lowe
          Lintas has worked on designing the right creatives that easily
          explains the brand philosophy and offerings. Hence, the creatives were
          coined using the greatest manifestation of people who truly believe
          there are no limits – children.
        </p>
        <p>
          The OOH campaign’s creative aims to draw a likeness between the
          child-like belief and imagination that anything can be made possible.
          It definitely increases audience impression numbers and dwell time as
          Digital OOH medium gives more scope for innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brand is strategically running multiple creatives on a variety of
          Digital screens across the departure and arrival of the airport.
          Digital OOH media is giving an extended reach to the brand with
          multiple creatives as the format ensures the continued interest and
          attention of the passengers at the Mumbai Airport. The campaign has
          been deployed for a duration of three months.

          “Kirloskar Limitless is an overwhelming campaign. Kirloskar is one of
          the most renowned and successful brands in the country and working
          with them has been an enriching experience for us. The brand has
          chosen Mumbai Airport Media exclusively in the OOH marketing to seek
          the right exposure for their biggest marketing stunt in recent times.
          While the airport audience is the best suited for the brand, the
          premium quality Digital OOH media is also enhancing the exquisiteness
          of the creatives.<br />
          We are looking for promising and longstanding outcomes for the brand”,
          says Sumit Chadha, Business Head, Times OOH. Times OOH offers

          <b>Sailesh Muthu</b>, CEO of
          <a class="text-secondary" href="https://www.admavin.com"> AdMAVIN</a>
          said that “A brand like Kirlorkar is known for innovative products and
          out of the box OOH Campaign. AdMAVIN has helped several brands in
          airport advertisement by their in-house product Air Transit Analyser
          where one can understand the arrival and departure time of flights and
          with the right kind of analytics one could plan smart advertising
          campaigns designed for specific target crowds at specific hours of the
          day in and around the target Airports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sailesh also predicted a great future for it. As per him, rising
          working groups and widening middle class demography has caused a major
          boost in the aviation sector of India in the last decade and India
          will become the third largest aviation market worldwide, in terms of
          passengers by 2024 according to current studies.
