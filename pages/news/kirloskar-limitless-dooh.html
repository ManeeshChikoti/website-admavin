      KIRLOSKAR "LIMITLESS" DOOH CAMPAIGN SHINING MUMBAI AIRPORT
    </h1>
    <hr class="my-0" />

    <p class="pt-3">
      The campaign was launched in partnership with OOH giant Times Media.

    <p class="pt-3">
      A 130-year-old industry leader, Kirloskar refreshes its campaign with
      a new age Digital OOH at the Mumbai Airport in partnership with Times
      OOH.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of innovation and purpose was captured through a new OOH
      Campaign – “Limitless” last year which has now been taken to the
      masses with the help of Airport Campaign.<br />
      The refreshing and re-energizing new campaign looks to expound on the
      Limitless philosophy in a simple, relatable & engaging manner that
      celebrates the brand’s shared philosophy with that of the innate human
      desire to challenge the limits and live, think and dream limitlessly.
      The brand in association with their advertisement media agency- Lowe
      Lintas has worked on designing the right creatives that easily
      explains the brand philosophy and offerings. Hence, the creatives were
      coined using the greatest manifestation of people who truly believe
      there are no limits – children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The OOH campaign’s creative aims to draw a likeness between the
      child-like belief and imagination that anything can be made possible.
      It definitely increases audience impression numbers and dwell time as
      Digital OOH medium gives more scope for innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brand is strategically running multiple creatives on a variety of
      Digital screens across the departure and arrival of the airport.
      Digital OOH media is giving an extended reach to the brand with
      multiple creatives as the format ensures the continued interest and
      attention of the passengers at the Mumbai Airport. The campaign has
      been deployed for a duration of three months.

      “Kirloskar Limitless is an overwhelming campaign. Kirloskar is one of
      the most renowned and successful brands in the country and working
      with them has been an enriching experience for us. The brand has
      chosen Mumbai Airport Media exclusively in the OOH marketing to seek
      the right exposure for their biggest marketing stunt in recent times.
      While the airport audience is the best suited for the brand, the
      premium quality Digital OOH media is also enhancing the exquisiteness
      of the creatives.<br />
      We are looking for promising and longstanding outcomes for the brand”,
      says Sumit Chadha, Business Head, Times OOH. Times OOH offers
      comprehensive media solutions across Airports, Metro, and Street
      furniture in India and Mauritius.

      <b>Sailesh Muthu</b>, CEO of
      <a class="text-secondary" href="https://www.admavin.com"> AdMAVIN</a>
      said that “A brand like Kirlorkar is known for innovative products and
      out of the box OOH Campaign. AdMAVIN has helped several brands in
      airport advertisement by their in-house product Air Transit Analyser
      where one can understand the arrival and departure time of flights and
      with the right kind of analytics one could plan smart advertising
      campaigns designed for specific target crowds at specific hours of the
      day in and around the target Airports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sailesh also predicted a great future for it. As per him, rising
      working groups and widening middle class demography has caused a major
      boost in the aviation sector of India in the last decade and India
      will become the third largest aviation market worldwide, in terms of
      passengers by 2024 according to current studies.
