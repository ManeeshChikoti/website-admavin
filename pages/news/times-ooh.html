              Times Innovative Media Limited (Times OOH) has secured the
              advertising rights for Manohar International Airport, a greenfield
              airport at Mopa in North Goa, for a period of 20 years. Developed
              by GMR group, the Mopa airport is a full-service airport designed
              to cater to domestic and international passengers and freight
              services, with a target passenger capacity of 13 million travelers
              per annum.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shekhar Narayanaswami, President of Times OOH, highlights the
              significance of the strategic location of the Mopa airport, which
              is expected to be the preferred transit point for travelers to and
              from Goa. Times OOH has deployed a wide range of world-class media
              options to cater to the contemporary and modern media objectives
              of local and international advertisers.

              In the OOH industry, planning a campaign in a transit station like
              an airport can be challenging, as noted by Sailesh Muthu, CEO of
              AdMAVIN. However, AdMAVIN has developed a tech capability to
              analyze passenger movements in airports and plan ad campaigns
              accordingly. With weekly or day-specific analytic reports based on
              arrival and departure traffic volumes, OOH industry leaders can
              make informed decisions to optimize brand exposure.
