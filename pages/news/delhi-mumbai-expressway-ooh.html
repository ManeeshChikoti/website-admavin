          The 1,386-km long expressway gives brands the advantage of achieving
          total market size and reaching a huge audience in a short time span.

          <p>
            The Delhi-Mumbai expressway, hailed as India's monumental
            infrastructure project, has put the OOH sector into high gear. As
            India's longest expressway, spanning 1,386 kilometers, it has
            significantly reduced travel time between Mumbai and Delhi to only
            12 hours, down from nearly 24 hours. The expressway's completion
            is anticipated by January 2024, with progress being made on
            multiple routes. Recently, PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the Sohna
            to Dausa stretch, which is expected to cut the distance between
            Gurgaon and Jaipur by two hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Various brands in the automotive, food, and travel industries are
            eager to leverage DOOH and OOH contextual and regional
            advertising, given the ease of capturing an audience's attention
            while they're on a long road trip. With such an extended stretch
            of road, it is easy to target travelers' attention and market to
            them effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming the potential, Tanvi Bosmia, Associate Account
            Director, Brand Experience, SoCheers, says given the distance,
            travel time and states it will traverse, the expressway will help
            brands attain a total market coverage and reach a wider audience
            within a short span of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mitesh Kothari, Co-founder and CCO, White Rivers Media, is also
            expecting exponential growth in OOH marketing this year overall as
            more and more offices have completely reopened and travel has
            resumed after the long pandemic fear and restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            "With the new Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, people are going to feel
            even more upbeat and motivated to travel for both leisure and
            work. Itâ€™s a golden moment for brands to go strong with strategic
            OOH advertising and unlock tremendous growth possibilities," he
            says.
          </p>
          <p>
            A report by AdEx India predicts a CAGR of 11.5% for the OOH
            advertising industry in India between 2020 and 2025. Additionally,
            a Nielsen study showed that OOH advertising can increase brand
            awareness by up to 54%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vikas Kumar Mangla, Founder and CEO, Digital ROI, says targeted
            message is essential for brands to connect with their intended
            viewers.
          </p>
          <p>
            He cited Airtel's DOOH campaign in 2019 targeting truck drivers as
            an example. In the campaign, digital billboards displayed
            information about Airtel's mobile data plans, and entertainment
            options such as movies and songs that truck drivers could stream
            on their mobile devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Delhi-Mumbai expressway, spanning across six Indian states
            including Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and
            Maharashtra, is poised to become a hotbed of activity for the OOH
            industry. This massive highway connects major cities such as Kota,
            Indore, Jaipur, Bhopal, Vadodara, and Surat, making it an ideal
            spot for brands to showcase their products and services to a
            diverse range of travelers, from business professionals to
            vacationers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brands in the OOH industry can leverage the high volume of traffic
            on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway by placing large-scale billboards,
            digital displays, and interactive installations along the route.
            By creating visually stunning and captivating content, they can
            effectively capture the attention of drivers and passengers and
            create a lasting impact on their target audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Targeting a wide audience on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway demands
            attention to the number of impressions and dwell time your media
            site can generate," asserts Sailesh Muthu, CEO of AdMAVIN, a
            leading player in the OOH industry. "AdMAVIN is here to provide
            the necessary metrics for optimal viewability and dwell time,
            maximizing brand exposure on this high-traffic route." Sailesh
            defines dwell time as the average duration that an observer spends
            within the viewability zone of a media site before moving past it.
