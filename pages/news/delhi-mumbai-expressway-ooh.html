              The Delhi-Mumbai expressway, hailed as India's monumental
              infrastructure project, has put the OOH sector into high gear. As
              India's longest expressway, spanning 1,386 kilometers, it has
              significantly reduced travel time between Mumbai and Delhi to only
              12 hours, down from nearly 24 hours. The expressway's completion
              is anticipated by January 2024, with progress being made on
              multiple routes. Recently, PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the Sohna
              to Dausa stretch, which is expected to cut the distance between
              Gurgaon and Jaipur by two hours.

              Various brands in the automotive, food, and travel industries are
              eager to leverage DOOH and OOH contextual and regional
              advertising, given the ease of capturing an audience's attention
              while they're on a long road trip. With such an extended stretch
              of road, it is easy to target travelers' attention and market to
              them effectively.

              Confirming the potential, Tanvi Bosmia, Associate Account
              Director, Brand Experience, SoCheers, says given the distance,
              travel time and states it will traverse, the expressway will help
              brands attain a total market coverage and reach a wider audience
              within a short span of time.

              Mitesh Kothari, Co-founder and CCO, White Rivers Media, is also
              expecting exponential growth in OOH marketing this year overall as
              more and more offices have completely reopened and travel has
              resumed after the long pandemic fear and restrictions.

              "With the new Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, people are going to feel
              even more upbeat and motivated to travel for both leisure and
              work. Itâ€™s a golden moment for brands to go strong with strategic
              OOH advertising and unlock tremendous growth possibilities," he
              says.
            </p>
            <p>
              A report by AdEx India predicts a CAGR of 11.5% for the OOH
              advertising industry in India between 2020 and 2025. Additionally,
              a Nielsen study showed that OOH advertising can increase brand
              awareness by up to 54%.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vikas Kumar Mangla, Founder and CEO, Digital ROI, says targeted
              message is essential for brands to connect with their intended
              viewers.
            </p>
            <p>
              He cited Airtel's DOOH campaign in 2019 targeting truck drivers as
              an example. In the campaign, digital billboards displayed
              information about Airtel's mobile data plans, and entertainment
              options such as movies and songs that truck drivers could stream
              on their mobile devices.

              The Delhi-Mumbai expressway, spanning across six Indian states
              including Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and
              Maharashtra, is poised to become a hotbed of activity for the OOH
              industry. This massive highway connects major cities such as Kota,
              Indore, Jaipur, Bhopal, Vadodara, and Surat, making it an ideal
              spot for brands to showcase their products and services to a
              diverse range of travelers, from business professionals to
              vacationers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brands in the OOH industry can leverage the high volume of traffic
              on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway by placing large-scale billboards,
              digital displays, and interactive installations along the route.
              By creating visually stunning and captivating content, they can
              effectively capture the attention of drivers and passengers and
              create a lasting impact on their target audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Targeting a wide audience on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway demands
              attention to the number of impressions and dwell time your media
              site can generate," asserts Sailesh Muthu, CEO of AdMAVIN, a
              leading player in the OOH industry. "AdMAVIN is here to provide
              the necessary metrics for optimal viewability and dwell time,
              maximizing brand exposure on this high-traffic route." Sailesh
              defines dwell time as the average duration that an observer spends
              within the viewability zone of a media site before moving past it.
