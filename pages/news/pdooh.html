          You must have seen several advertisements which vary with time on the
          same day. For example, you might see a BMW Ad during office hours and
          Horlicks Ad soon after school hours on the same screen. Programmatic
          Digital Out-Of-Home (pDOOH) allows you to choose to play different
          advertisements on the same screen as per your strategy to target
          audience.

          The OOH industry is undergoing a significant digital transformation as
          media owners are embracing the transition from traditional static
          billboards to digital formats. Ad buyers, media agencies, media
          owners, and ad technology vendors are also embracing the
          transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programmatic Digital Out-Of-Home (pDOOH), the automated process of
          buying, selling, and delivering DOOH inventory, is gaining the
          confidence of marketeers in the Indian OOH industry too. There has
          been a significant surge in the numbers of pDOOH campaigns executed
          across Times OOH properties including Airports and Mumbai Metro in
          this financial year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Times OOH has been witnessing a positive response to the Digital OOH
          formats across transit properties. Now with the advent of Programmatic
          advertising, automated buying and selling has further eased the
          process to execute DOOH campaigns for the clients by bridging the gap
          between the Demand-side Platform (DSP) and Supply-side Platform (SSP).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          There are multiple categories of brands executing pDOOH campaigns such
          as E-commerce brands Flipkart, Cleartrip, TATA Cliq, Automobile brands
          Royal Enfield, Mahindra, and Hyundai; Smartphone brand Oneplus, Vivo,
          and various others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another factor behind the influx of Programmatic DOOH campaigns is the
          Transparency and Measurability offered by the pDOOH campaigns as
          Programmatic campaigns provide clients access to the organic automated
          report of the advertisements’ impressions generated through the
          Content Management Software installed in the digital screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Post lockdown, the marketing initiatives have become highly targeted
          and result driven. And with the advent of Programmatic campaigns, the
          clients have the capability to critically plan and deeply analyse its
          impact which has driven their confidence in the Indian OOH industry.
          At our airports and metro properties, we have witnessed an exponential
          growth of programmatic campaigns by various leading clients, and we
          are happy to share that there is a certain growth in such campaigns
          with existing and new clients with the given comfort to execute plans
          with attributes such as transparency and measurability. DOOH is
          definitely an Impression Multiplier.”, comments Aman Nanda, Chief
          Strategy Officer, Times OOH.

          has hailed such transformations in the OOH industry. But he also
          cautioned media and brand agencies about measurability offered by
          several tech companies. Most of the tech companies depend on mobile
          data whose penetration in the Indian market is very low and thus
          doesn’t capture the whole thing. He also explained that AdMAVIN
          methodology shows traffic and mobile based audience measurement
          separately and thus is more reliable in terms of audience measurement.
