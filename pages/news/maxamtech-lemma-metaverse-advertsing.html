              Lemma, a leading supply-side platform for large format ads, has
              announced its collaboration with Maxamtech Digital Ventures to
              launch metaverse billboards in the real world for DOOH clients.
              Brands can now create a dual experience for spectators in both the
              virtual and actual worlds through Lemma, resulting in dual impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              The partnership between Lemma and Maxamtech will assist global
              brands in creating brand impressions on untapped audiences through
              virtual media in the Metaverse. Billboard advertising in the
              Metaverse is currently relatively affordable, making it a
              potentially lucrative opportunity to target new audiences entering
              the Metaverse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maxamtech is a well-known player in the gaming and virtual worlds
              market, and together with Lemma, they will offer clients strategic
              in-game placements and enrich customer engagement by allowing
              advertisers to redirect users to their website or landing page.
            </p>

              Maxamtech is a well known player with a growing audience in the
              gaming and virtual worlds market. Maxamtech and Lemma will offer
              clients strategic in-game placements and enrich customer
              engagement by allowing advertisers to redirect users to their

            <p>
              Gulab Patil, Founder and CEO of Lemma, said," Metaverse billboards
              can reach a global audience and help expand a brand's reach and
              target new markets efficiently. Further, virtual billboards can
              show unique advertisements to each user based on their
              demographics, interests, and actions. Ad personalisation reduces
              waste and boosts the efficiency of advertising campaigns as a
              whole." He continues, "Our decision to offer metaverse billboards
              to the clients will ensure that brands who aim to reinvent
              themselves to align with audiences in the Metaverse as new
              patterns of behavior and consumption emerge will be able to do
              hassle-free through Lemma."
            </p>
            <p>
              "We are constantly looking for new and exciting ways to grow and
              monetise our gaming platform, and this partnership with Lemma
              presents a perfect opportunity to do so. We look forward to
              working with them to offer brands and advertisers innovative ways
              to reach audiences with engaging and cutting-edge new ad units,"
              concluded Xerxes Mullan, Founder of Maxamtech Digital Ventures

              As the metaverse industry continues to grow, brands can utilize
              billboards as a starting point for their advertising efforts and
              then expand into other opportunities such as events, product
              placements, content creation, and virtual influencers to make a
              lasting impression on their target audience.
            </p>
