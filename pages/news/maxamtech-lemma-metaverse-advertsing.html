            Lemma, a leading supply-side platform for large format ads, has
            announced its collaboration with Maxamtech Digital Ventures to
            launch metaverse billboards in the real world for DOOH clients.
            Brands can now create a dual experience for spectators in both the
            virtual and actual worlds through Lemma, resulting in dual impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            The partnership between Lemma and Maxamtech will assist global
            brands in creating brand impressions on untapped audiences through
            virtual media in the Metaverse. Billboard advertising in the
            Metaverse is currently relatively affordable, making it a
            potentially lucrative opportunity to target new audiences entering
            the Metaverse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maxamtech is a well-known player in the gaming and virtual worlds
            market, and together with Lemma, they will offer clients strategic
            in-game placements and enrich customer engagement by allowing
            advertisers to redirect users to their website or landing page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maxamtech is a well known player with a growing audience in the
            gaming and virtual worlds market. Maxamtech and Lemma will offer
            clients strategic in-game placements and enrich customer
            engagement by allowing advertisers to redirect users to their
            website or landing page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gulab Patil, Founder and CEO of Lemma, said," Metaverse billboards
            can reach a global audience and help expand a brand's reach and
            target new markets efficiently. Further, virtual billboards can
            show unique advertisements to each user based on their
            demographics, interests, and actions. Ad personalisation reduces
            waste and boosts the efficiency of advertising campaigns as a
            whole." He continues, "Our decision to offer metaverse billboards
            to the clients will ensure that brands who aim to reinvent
            themselves to align with audiences in the Metaverse as new
            patterns of behavior and consumption emerge will be able to do
            hassle-free through Lemma."
          </p>
          <p>
            "We are constantly looking for new and exciting ways to grow and
            monetise our gaming platform, and this partnership with Lemma
            presents a perfect opportunity to do so. We look forward to
            working with them to offer brands and advertisers innovative ways
            to reach audiences with engaging and cutting-edge new ad units,"
            concluded Xerxes Mullan, Founder of Maxamtech Digital Ventures
          </p>
          <p>
            As the metaverse industry continues to grow, brands can utilize
            billboards as a starting point for their advertising efforts and
            then expand into other opportunities such as events, product
            placements, content creation, and virtual influencers to make a
            lasting impression on their target audience.
          </p>

            Sailesh Muthu, the CEO of AdMAVIN, expressed his excitement about
            the partnership between OOH and metaverse industry players to
            effectively reach their audience for a dual impact. AdMAVIN is a
            tech company that prioritizes understanding target groups and
