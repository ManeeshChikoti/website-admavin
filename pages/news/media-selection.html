          MEDIA SELECTION- FACTORS TO KEEP IN MIND WHILE SELECTING MEDIA SITE
          TYPE
        </h1>

        <p class="pt-3">
          It's very often that Brands and even Media-Agencies get confused while
          selecting out of home media sites for campaigns as they are very much
          similar.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img
            class="news-image my-3"
            src="../../assets/news/media-selection/city.png"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          So can brands make the right selection in media sites which targets
          their audience, boost marketing and contribute towards sales
          generation. Brands mostly have the following goals by doing billboard
          based advertising-
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pitching an advertisement to the proper target group.</li>
          <li>Reaching out to the maximum number of target groups.</li>
          <li>Covering Competitor Influence Region/Area.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Let’s say there is a series of two types of Unipole which satisfies
          all the three ask/goals of the campaign. So how should one finalize
          one of those media sites? What are the criteria for selection of media
          sites?
        </p>

        <p>
          Media sites types are important as advertisement has to be visible to
          your target audience. You must have noticed a certain slant in
          elevation, tilt and particular size billboards. You may think that
          it's arbitrary but actually it's very well thought out and full of
          rationale.

          So let’s see the factors that one has to consider while selecting
          media sites-
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="mb-3">
            <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Media site elevation:</p>

              - How well a media site is placed in the target group influence
              market area?
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The 1st media site is placed between 14 feet.</li>
              <li>The 2nd media site is placed between 8 feet.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li class="mb-3">
            <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Size of the media site:</p>
            <p class="mb-0">- What should be the size of the media site?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The 1st media site 2X5.</li>
              <li>The 2nd media site 3X7.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li class="mb-3">
            <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Flow of the incoming traffic:</p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              - Which one should be selected? When both of them are placed
              alternatively in a series?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="mb-3">
            <p class="fw-bold mb-0">
              Dwell time spent by the incoming traffic:

            <p class="mb-0">- Which of the following should be selected?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                For 1st media dwell time is 6 sec as it is placed over 14 feet.
              </li>
              <li>
                For 2nd media dwell time is 3 sec as it is placed over 8 feet.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li class="mb-3">
            <p class="fw-bold mb-0">
              Cluster of Media sites near your media sites:
