          Honda launched first of its type floating Out of Home Advertisement
          (OOH) in famous Kerala backwaters which caught eyeballs of brands and

          Interestingly, marketing idea looks very similar to Indian Post Office
          in Srinagar’s famous Dal Lake.

          Atsushi Ogata, Managing Director, President & CEO, Honda Motorcycle &
          Scooter India applauded the success of the marketing campaign and
          said, “We wanted to create an experience for our local audience and
          narrate a story that would be relatable to them. Through the floating
          showroom activation, we are delighted that our connection with our
          consumers has grown stronger. The result achieved so far is a
          testimony of Honda’s strong customer connect and we are optimistic
          that this will contribute to building better and prolonged relations
          with our audience".

          Gour Gupta, Managing Director of Tribes Communication which has
          designed the marketing campaign was equally delighted as he said, “A
          brand storytelling has to be creative, compelling and engaging.
          Through the floating showroom activation, we wanted to create an
          unprecedented experience for the audience. We are glad to have
          generated a huge impact on the queries from the customers and are

          Since recovery from Covid has started, brands are again looking
          forward to OOH for impactful advertisement. OOH is not only offering
          creative solutions but also offering geo spatial data based
          methodology where one can also measure the number of audience that
          visit through the particular site. Sailesh Muthu, CEO of AdMAVIN which
          is a pioneer in OOH Audience Measurement explains it as “
          OTS(Opportunity to See) is the number that we talk about when we say
          audience measurement. OTS will significantly improve as creative
          advertisement grabs more eyeballs. It not only improves brand
          awareness but also helps media sites utilize their full potential".
