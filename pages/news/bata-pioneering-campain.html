          Bata India came up with a 3D OOH billboard that utilizes an anamorphic
          image content creation format thereby making content appear in 3
          dimensions, which are visually compelling. Bata has used this
          innovative OOH technology to highlight the variety of sneakers it
          offers with the Sneaker Studios launched across 300+ stores across the
          country.

          This 3D billboard is a visual treat for potential consumers and
          immediately commands attention. Thus it increases impression numbers
          and dwell time for audiences. The OOH advertising features sneakers
          from various brands like Power, that’s used for fitness and NorthStar,
          the lifestyle sneaker brand from Bata. Made to engage its right Target
          Group which happens to be youth audiences, the 3D Out of Home
          Advertisement seamlessly marries various animations like a moving
          skateboard, sneakers popping out of a shoe box and a train of multiple
          sneakers streaming from the billboard thereby creating a compelling
          story.

          said: <br />
          “At Bata India, we are constantly looking for innovative ways to
          engage with our audience. We are elated to be one of the first few
          brands and especially, the first footwear brand in India to bring the
          disruptive format of 3D OOH advertising. As we offer over 300 sneakers
          styles from 9 international brands in our new Sneaker Studios, a
          shop-in-shop destination inside Bata stores, we thought of leveraging
          the new 3D emerging outdoor media to announce this launch.<br />
          Consumers can experience Sneaker Studio in their neighborhood Bata
          stores and get to shop their favorite styles instantly or even order
          them via home delivery service.”

          said “I am happy to see that BATA company is the first footwear brand
          in India to come up with the 3D OOH advertising and innovating itself
          over the time by being on top of with all creative ideas within the
          OOH industry. As per him, AdMAVIN has done several research papers and
          demonstrated through its tool that creative OOH Campaigns definitely
          increase OTS(Opportunity to See) and Dwell time. Campaign Planning
          around 3D OOH Campaigns is bound to be successful but it's also
          costly.”
