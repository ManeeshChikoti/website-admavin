          Bumble, the women-first dating and social networking app, launched its
          new out-of-home campaign that captures nuanced dating cultures in
          cities including Kolkata and Ahmedabad. Ahead of the festival season,
          Bumble’s latest OOH campaign aims to support the community to navigate
          their dating journeys and encourage women to make the first move for
          initiating the conversion.

          The new OOH campaign takes a humorous, city-specific, hyper-localised
          look at nuanced dating cultures during festivals featuring taglines
          such as “Find the Kasundi to your Kabiraji”, “Find a Pujo date who’ll
          go, “Asche Bochor Abar Hobe'' with you” in Kolkata and “You, me, and
          gwalia dosa at Manek Chowk”, “Find the double butter to your vada pav.
          Date on Bumble.” in Ahmedabad.

          idea of festive fun and your favorite festival food, puja pandals
          you’d like to visit, a garba dance you’ve been eyeing to
          attend–festivals can be an exciting time to find new connections that
          you’re looking for! With our latest campaign, we aim to encourage our
          community to own their dating journeys and find their connections on
          Bumble.”
